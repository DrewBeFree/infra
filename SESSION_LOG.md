## 2026-05-20 00:43 — WSL statusLine fix + log-session skill

**What we did:**
- Diagnosed why `/statusline` kept saying "not set up" — the statusline-setup skill checks `.zshrc` for PS1 and always gives a false negative; the real setup is a standalone bash script
- Root cause: WSL uses `/home/drew/.claude/settings.json` (was missing `statusLine`); PowerShell uses `/mnt/c/Users/drewb/.claude/settings.json` (had it)
- Fixed WSL statusLine by adding the config to `/home/drew/.claude/settings.json`
- Saved memory so we never run statusline-setup again for this
- Designed and built `/log-session` skill: auto-generates session entry, pushes to infra `SESSION_LOG.md` (atlas dashboard), memory log, and current project log
- Updated `/logoff` skill to call `/log-session` as its final logging step
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` logoff checklist to match (steps 6 & 7 collapsed into one)
- Pushed infra repo (spec, plan, this entry)

**Where we stopped:**
- `/log-session` skill is live but requires a new Claude Code session to be discoverable

**Next up:**
- Open a new session and run `/log-session` to confirm it shows up on atlas

## 2026-05-19 — Dashboard redesign + deploy to atlas

**What we did:**
- Verified dashboard was not deployed to atlas; fixed WSL SSH using Windows key
- Merged infra dev → main and pushed to GitHub
- Cloned infra repo on atlas; confirmed nginx already configured at /opt/homelab-status-dashboard
- Redesigned dashboard with Pro Blue theme: Space Grotesk font, navy header, blue→purple→cyan gradient divider, white cards on light blue-gray bg
- Added live indicator: pulsing dot (amber=fetching, green=live, red=error)
- Added session timestamp support (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format) with same-day session stacking
- Grouped backlog by type: Infrastructure / Apps / Sites / Agents
- Added +N remaining badge to Up Next; infra sorted to top
- Added hosting machine indicator (⬡ atlas) in header eyebrow
- Added XSS-safe esc() helper in render.js

**Where we stopped:**
- Mobile browser may need hard refresh to pick up sort order change
- `http://atlas` shortname not resolving on Windows (hosts file fix pending)

**Next up:**
- Verify mobile shows infra first after hard refresh
- Add `100.71.165.80 atlas` to Windows hosts file for shortname access
- Use `## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — context` format for all future session log entries

## 2026-05-19 — homelab-status-dashboard build + housekeeping

**What we did:**
- Designed and built homelab-status-dashboard (data.js, render.js, index.html) inside infra repo
- Wrote design spec and implementation plan to docs/superpowers/
- Fixed UTF-8 decode bug and session log date parsing in data.js
- Redesigned dashboard with Command Center-inspired dark aesthetic (single index.html)
- Partially deployed to atlas — data loads, backlog accordion not expanding yet
- Moved interactive-setup/ from infra/ to agents/interactive-setup/, inited as own git repo
- Added interactive-setup to repos.json
- Added 4 new backlog items (unified terminal, dashboard redesign, clone strategy, Docker strategy)

**Where we stopped:**
- infra dev branch not yet merged to main or pushed
- interactive-setup not yet pushed to GitHub
- Dashboard backlog accordion expand/collapse still broken
- Dashboard redesign not fully verified on atlas

**Next up:**
- Fix backlog accordion expand/collapse
- Verify redesigned index.html on atlas
- Merge infra dev → main and push
- Create interactive-setup GitHub repo and push
- Tackle unified terminal / cross-machine access

## 2026-05-18

**What we did:**
- Created STRUCTURE.md with directory standards and naming conventions
- Created repos.json manifest (14 cloneable repos)
- Created clone-all.ps1 and clone-all.sh scripts for multi-system setup
- Reorganized: extracted ai-dog-trainer from DrewBeFree, converted DrewBeFree to profile-only
- Created BACKLOG.md for persistent infrastructure task tracking
- Built update-session-logs wrapper scripts (PowerShell & Bash) for multi-repo SESSION_LOG updates
- Updated scripts to read baseDirectory from repos.json for cross-system compatibility

**Where we stopped:**
- Wrapper scripts tested and committed, ready for WSL setup

**Next up:**
- Set up WSL development environment, test scripts in bash, then proceed to Task 2 (project templates)

# Session Log

## 2026-05-18 â€” Repository reorganization: Extract ai-dog-trainer from DrewBeFree

**What we did:**
- Created new `ai-dog-trainer` repository under `apps/`
- Extracted dog trainer code from DrewBeFree: app.py, requirements.txt, static/, etc.
- Initialized git repo locally and pushed to GitHub
- Converted DrewBeFree to profile-only repository (GitHub profile README)
- Updated `repos.json` to add ai-dog-trainer and remove DrewBeFree from cloning manifest
- Result: cleaner organization with ai-dog-trainer as standalone app

**Where we stopped:**
- Repository reorganization complete
- All repos committed and pushed
- repos.json updated with new structure

**Next up:**
- Task 1 still in progress: update SESSION_LOG and close out

## 2026-05-18 â€” Task 1: Audit & document directory structure + naming conventions

**What we did:**
- Scanned entire GitHub directory structure across all 7 categories (apps/, sites/, agents/, infra/, notes/, DrewBeFree/, _worktrees/)
- Analyzed project patterns: 9 web apps, 3 sites, 1 agent, infra, backend
- Documented directory structure templates for 4 project types (PWA, static site, Python, Docker)
- Identified naming conventions: kebab-case projects, lowercase standard dirs, git branch patterns (main/dev/feat/fix/claude)
- Created `STRUCTURE.md` â€” comprehensive reference documenting all standards, templates, and documentation requirements
- Created `repos.json` â€” manifest listing all 15 repositories with GitHub URLs and target directories
- Created `clone-all.ps1` â€” PowerShell script to clone entire structure on Windows
- Created `clone-all.sh` â€” Bash script to clone entire structure on Linux/macOS

**Where we stopped:**
- Task 1 complete and all deliverables committed
- Multi-machine setup now supported: any machine can run clone script to replicate folder structure

**Next up:**
- Task 2: Create project templates for apps and sites (blocked by Task 1 âœ… now unblocked)

## 2026-05-18 â€” Infrastructure repo creation and backlog setup

**What we did:**
- Created new `infra` GitHub repository (separate from `homelab`)
- Moved broad infrastructure docs from homelab to infra root:
  - `infrastructure-tools.md` â€” tools reference for Alienware + PowerEdge
  - `alienware-vs-poweredge.md` â€” workload split decision rule
- Created `INFRASTRUCTURE.md` â€” strategic backlog and task list
- Established priority order for infrastructure work:
  1. Directory structure + naming conventions
  2. Project templates
  3. Multi-system sync strategy (deadline: 2026-06-02)
  4. Automation of recurring tasks

**Where we stopped:**
- Infra repo initialized and pushed to GitHub
- Infrastructure backlog documented and prioritized
- Task list created (internal tracking)

**Next up:**
- Task #1: Audit and document directory structure + naming conventions
- Define directory hierarchy standards
- Establish file naming conventions
- Document project organization strategy
